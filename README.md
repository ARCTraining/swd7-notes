# SWD7 - Introdution to Data Visualisation with Python

This course is designed to introduce concepts relating to good data visualisation, utilising packages available for Python.

This course should be useful for anyone who works with data and needs to visualise results. While the term “scientific data visualisation” is used in this documentation due to the sources we have collated, the subject matter and example datasets should be applicable to wider research areas than STEM.

This course focuses on the production of static visualisations, and not interactive dashboards.
